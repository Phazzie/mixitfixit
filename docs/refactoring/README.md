   - **Status**: Current - Detailed plan for test improvements aligned with refactoring goals
   - **Key Content**: Missing tests, quality improvements, infrastructure needs, file changes
   - **Last Updated**: March 2025

## Partially Superseded Documents ⚠️

2. **phase1_implementation_plan.md**
   - **Purpose**: Detailed day-by-day plan for Phase 1 (Core SRP Fixes)
   - **Status**: Partially Current - Some components in server/src/services/analysis are already implementing this approach
   - **Key Content**: Pre-implementation steps, daily tasks, success criteria, and risk mitigation
   - **Last Updated**: March 2025

3. **refactoring_master_plan.md**
   - **Purpose**: High-level strategic plan outlining the principles and phases for the entire refactoring effort
   - **Status**: Partially Current - Overall principles still apply, but implementation details superseded by newer TypeScript architecture
   - **Key Content**: SRP, DRY, KISS, SOLID principles, technical implementation plan, phases and timeline
   - **Last Updated**: March 2025

## Outdated Documents ❌

4. **refactoring_guide.md**
   - **Purpose**: Original guide explaining the rationale and high-level approach to refactoring
   - **Status**: Outdated - Superseded by TypeScript-based server architecture and newer plans
   - **Key Content**: Current state analysis, guiding principles, objectives
   - **Last Updated**: Earlier project phase

5. **side_refactor.md** (Plan B)
   - **Purpose**: Alternative refactoring approach using React Context API and custom hooks
   - **Status**: Outdated - Implementation has moved beyond this approach with TypeScript services
   - **Key Content**: Prompts for implementing Context API, custom hooks, component refactoring
   - **Last Updated**: Earlier project phase

6. **srp_refactoring_plan.md**
   - **Purpose**: Analysis of SRP and DRY violations with solutions
   - **Status**: Outdated - Initial analysis now incorporated into newer TypeScript implementation
   - **Key Content**: Identified violations, solutions, file changes
   - **Last Updated**: Earlier phase, now superseded by TypeScript services architecture

## Current Implementation Status

Based on the recent files, the project has progressed beyond the original refactoring plans to a more sophisticated TypeScript-based architecture in the server services:

- **TypeScript Services Architecture**: ✅ In Progress
  - Service classes following SOLID principles
  - Proper dependency injection
  - Interface-based design
  - Well-structured unit tests

- **Examples of Current Implementation**:
  - `server/src/services/analysis/sentiment/SentimentAnalyzer.ts`
  - `server/src/services/analysis/sentiment/SentimentTokenizer.ts`
  - `server/src/services/analysis/sentiment/SentimentScoreCalculator.ts`
  - `server/src/services/analysis/sentiment/SentimentDictionary.ts`
  - `server/src/services/analysis/sentiment/ScoreNormalizer.ts`

## Next Actions

1. Complete the remaining test coverage for new TypeScript services
2. Follow the testing_improvement_plan.md for comprehensive test coverage
3. Document the new TypeScript service architecture that's replacing the previous plans
4. Consider updating the master plan to reflect the current TypeScript-based implementation

## Note on Documentation Freshness

The server-side code appears to be following a more advanced TypeScript-based architecture than what was outlined in the original refactoring plans. The testing_improvement_plan.md remains the most current and relevant document for ongoing improvements.
