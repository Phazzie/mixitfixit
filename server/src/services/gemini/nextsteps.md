Prioritized Next Steps (Top 8):

These steps are ordered by importance and dependency. Completing them in this order will set you up for success.

Implement Basic Steel-Manning Logic: (Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: This is a core feature of your application and is essential for the user experience. Getting this working, even in a basic form, will demonstrate the app's value proposition.
What to do:
Implement the logic for users to restate each other's issues.
Implement the logic for users to confirm if the restatement is accurate.
Modify the UI to "lock" statements once they are confirmed.
Implement code to prevent editing of locked statements.
Dependencies: This must be done after implementing Issue Proposal and Agreement.
Impact: High - Core feature, user experience.
Checklist: project_checklist.md - "Implement Basic Steel-Manning"
Implement Basic Discussion Phase: (Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: Another core feature. Users need to be able to discuss the issue.
What to do:
Create the basic UI for real-time back-and-forth typing.
Ensure that the code is commented.
Dependencies: Steel-manning should be implemented first.
Impact: High - Core feature, user experience.
Checklist: project_checklist.md - "Implement Basic Discussion Phase"
Implement Basic Resolution Phase: (Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: This is the culmination of the process. Users need to be able to propose and agree on resolutions.
What to do:
Implement the UI elements for proposing resolutions.
Implement the logic for handling Accept, Modify, and Reject actions.
Ensure that the code is commented.
Add unit tests.
Dependencies: Steel-manning and discussion should be implemented first.
Impact: High - Core feature, user experience.
Checklist: project_checklist.md - "Implement Basic Resolution Phase"
Implement Basic Summary Phase: (Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: Users need a record of what was discussed and agreed upon.
What to do:
Implement the UI for the summary.
Implement the logic to show the required data (issue, statements, resolution).
Ensure that the code is commented.
Add unit tests.
Dependencies: Steel-manning, discussion, and resolution should be implemented first.
Impact: High - Core feature, user experience.
Checklist: project_checklist.md - "Implement Basic Summary Phase"
Add Unit Tests to Steel-Manning, Discussion, Resolution, and Summary: (Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: You need to start building a safety net to prevent bugs and ensure that your core features work as expected.
What to do:
Write unit tests for the logic you just implemented in the steel-manning, discussion, resolution, and summary phases.
Follow the guidelines in testing_guide.md.
Dependencies: The features must be implemented first.
Impact: High - Code quality, bug prevention, maintainability.
Checklist: project_checklist.md - "Implement Basic Steel-Manning", "Implement Basic Discussion Phase", "Implement Basic Resolution Phase", "Implement Basic Summary Phase"
Complete the StatementsContext.js file: (Plan B, Priority: High)
Why: This is the foundation of the refactor.
What to do:
Create the StatementsProvider component.
Define the initial state for the statements.
Create the useStatements hook.
Create the reducer function.
Implement the addStatement function in the reducer.
Dependencies: The file must be created.
Impact: High - Code quality, maintainability.
Checklist: side_refactor.md - "Context API Setup (Centralized Data Store)"
Refactor a Component to Use Hooks and Context: (Plan B, Phase 2, Priority: High)
Why: You need to start applying the Plan B refactoring to your components. Doing one component completely will give you a template for the rest.
What to do:
Choose a component (e.g., one that handles user input or displays statements).
Remove direct state management related to statements.
Import and use the useStatementsManager hook to get statements.
Import and use the useErrorHandler hook to set and display errors.
Make sure all the functions of the hooks are called correctly.
Remove all the prop drilling.
Add a test file for the refactored component.
Dependencies: The hooks and contexts must be created first.
Impact: High - Code quality, maintainability, sets a pattern for future refactoring.
Checklist: side_refactor.md - "Component Refactoring"
Add Tests for the Hooks and the Refactored Component: (Plan B, Phase 3, Priority: High)
Why: You need to ensure that your new hooks and refactored component work correctly.
What to do:
Create a new test file for the useStatementsManager hook.
Create a new test file for the useSummarizeStatements hook.
Create a new test file for the useErrorHandler hook.
Test that the hooks get the statements correctly.
Test that the hooks add statements correctly.
Test that the hooks handle the AI summarization correctly.
Test that the hooks handle errors correctly.
Test that the refactored component renders correctly.
Test that the refactored component calls the hooks' functions correctly.
Dependencies: The hooks and the component must be refactored first.
Impact: High - Code quality, bug prevention, maintainability.
Checklist: side_refactor.md - "Testing Custom Hooks", "Testing Components"
Reasoning:

Core Features First: The first four steps focus on getting the core features of your app working. This is essential for demonstrating the app's value and getting early feedback.
Testing Early: Testing is integrated early to prevent bugs and ensure that your code works as expected.
Plan B Refactoring: The next steps start the Plan B refactoring, which will improve the long-term maintainability and scalability of your app.
Context and Hooks: The context and hooks are the foundation of the refactor.
Refactor a component: Refactoring a component will give you a template for the rest.
Test the hooks and component: Testing the hooks and component will ensure they work correctly.
