# Testing Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines the testing strategy for the Relationship Resolver project. Effective testing ensures the application's quality, reliability, and correctness.

## Importance of Testing

*   **Early Bug Detection:** Testing helps identify bugs and issues early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort of fixing them later.
*   **Improved Code Quality:** Writing tests encourages writing modular and testable code, leading to better code design.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Comprehensive testing reduces the risk of application failure in production.
*   **Facilitates Refactoring:** Tests act as a safety net when refactoring code, ensuring that changes do not introduce new bugs.

## Testing and Verification

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

*   **Concept:** TDD is a development approach where tests are written before the code.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Write a test that defines a specific functionality.
    2.  Run the test (it should fail).
    3.  Write the code that makes the test pass.
    4.  Refactor the code and run the tests again.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Ensures that all code is testable.
    *   Results in more modular and robust code.
    *   Serves as living documentation of how the code should behave.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Process:**
    1.  When a bug is discovered, write a test that reproduces the bug.
    2.  Run the test (it should fail).
    3.  Fix the code to make the test pass.
    4.  Ensure that all tests pass after fixing the bug.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Prevents regressions (bugs that reappear after being fixed).
    *   Ensures that the fix addresses the root cause of the bug.

## Running Tests

### How to Run

*   **Command:** `npm test` (frontend and server).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Navigate to the `client` directory in your terminal.
    2.  Run `npm test`.
    3.  Navigate to the `server` directory in your terminal.
    4.  Run `npm test`.
    5. Check that all the tests are passing.

## How to Create Tests

### General structure

* **test() or it()**: Create the test using one of these two functions.
* **describe()**: Create a group of tests using this function.
* **expect()**: Use this function to check if the code is working as expected.
* **toBe(), toEqual()**: Use these functions inside the expect function to make a test.
*   **Arrange, Act, Assert**: Make sure each test follows these steps:
    *   **Arrange**: Set up the necessary context and data for the test.
    *   **Act**: Perform the action or method being tested.
    *   **Assert**: Verify that the result of the action matches the expected outcome.
* **Mocking:** When testing code that relies on external dependencies (like APIs, databases, or third-party libraries), use mocking to simulate those dependencies. This ensures that the tests remain isolated and don't depend on the availability or behavior of external systems.
* **Test data:** Test using different inputs and scenarios, to make sure everything is working as expected.
* **Edge Cases**: Always test the edge cases.

### Example



### Unit Tests

*   **Definition:** Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of the application in isolation, such as functions, methods, or classes.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure that each unit of code works correctly on its own.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Identify bugs early in the development process.
    *   Make it easier to refactor code.
    *   Serve as documentation for how the code should work (specification).
*   **Appropriate Use:** Ideal for testing core logic, algorithms, and individual components without external dependencies.
* **Test Scope**: Tests a small and isolated part of the code.
### Integration Tests

*   **Definition:** Integration tests verify that different units or components of the application work correctly together.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure that the interaction between components is seamless and that the application functions as a whole.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Identify integration issues that might not be caught by unit tests.
    *   Ensure that data flows correctly between components.
    *   Validate the application's overall behavior.
*   **Appropriate Use:** Suitable for testing API interactions, component communication, and data flow between different parts of the application.
* **Test Scope**: Tests the interactions between components.

## 3. Testing Environment

### Frontend Testing Environment

*   **Tools/Libraries:**
    *   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework that provides a rich set of features for writing and running tests.
    *   **React Testing Library:** A library for testing React components in a way that focuses on how the components are used by the user.
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Jest, React Testing Library, and jest-dom: `npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`
    2.  Configure Jest by creating a `jest.config.js` file.
    3.  Create a `tests` directory in the frontend `client` folder to store test files.
    4. Add jest configuration to package.json

### Server Testing Environment

*   **Tools/Libraries:**
    *   **Jest:** A versatile testing framework that can be used for both frontend and backend testing.
    *   **Supertest:** A library for testing HTTP servers, which is ideal for testing API endpoints.
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Jest and Supertest: `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`
    2. Configure jest by creating a `jest.config.js` file.
    3. Create a `tests` directory in the server folder to store test files.

## 4. Test Organization

### Concept

*   Test coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of code that is executed by tests.
*   It helps identify areas of the codebase that have not been adequately tested.

### Best Practices
*   **Group tests**: Place all the tests of a component in the same folder.
*   **Descriptive names**: Give the tests and files descriptive names.
*   **One component per file**: Each test file should only test one component.
* **Focus on Critical Areas:** Prioritize testing critical functionality, complex algorithms, and error-prone areas.
*   **Meaningful Tests**: Focus on writing meaningful tests that cover various scenarios and edge cases, rather than just aiming for a high percentage.
*   **Keep it simple**: Make sure the tests are easy to read and understand.
*   **Clear and concise**: Write clear and concise tests.

## 5. Specific Test Cases

### General Structure

Each component test will have its own test file and will follow this structure:

*   **Component/Module:** The part of the application being tested.
*   **Test Name:** A descriptive name for the test.
*   **Test Type:** Unit or integration.
*   **Test Description:** What the test is designed to verify, using `describe`.
* **Individual test**: using `it` or `test`.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The outcome if the code works correctly.
*   **Number of Tests:** The recommended number of tests for each scenario.
*   **Example Code:** An example of a test case.

## 6. Frontend Test Cases

### CodeGenerator Component

*   **Component/Module:** `CodeGenerator`
*   **Test Name:** `generates a 6-character alphanumeric code`
*   **Test Type:** Unit
*   **Test Description:** Verify that the component generates a random code that is exactly 6 characters
