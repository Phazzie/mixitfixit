# Testing Guide: Relationship Resolver Project

## 1. Introduction to Testing

Testing is a critical part of the software development process that ensures the quality, reliability, and correctness of an application. It involves executing the application with various inputs and scenarios to verify that it behaves as expected and meets its requirements. Thorough testing helps identify bugs, improve code quality, and reduce the risk of application failure. In the Relationship Resolver project, testing will be used to improve the quality of the application.

## 2. Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

*   **Definition:** Unit tests focus on testing individual units or components of the application in isolation, such as functions, methods, or classes.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure that each unit of code works correctly on its own.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Identify bugs early in the development process.
    *   Make it easier to refactor code.
    *   Serve as documentation for how the code should work.
*   **Appropriate Use:** Ideal for testing core logic, algorithms, and individual components without external dependencies.

### Integration Tests

*   **Definition:** Integration tests verify that different units or components of the application work correctly together.
*   **Purpose:** To ensure that the interaction between components is seamless and that the application functions as a whole.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Identify integration issues that might not be caught by unit tests.
    *   Ensure that data flows correctly between components.
    *   Validate the application's overall behavior.
*   **Appropriate Use:** Suitable for testing API interactions, component communication, and data flow between different parts of the application.

## 3. Testing Environment

### Frontend Testing Environment

*   **Tools/Libraries:**
    *   **Jest:** A JavaScript testing framework that provides a rich set of features for writing and running tests.
    *   **React Testing Library:** A library for testing React components in a way that focuses on how the components are used by the user.
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Jest and React Testing Library: `npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`
    2.  Configure Jest: create a `jest.config.js` file.
    3.  Create a `__tests__` directory in the frontend to store test files.

### Backend Testing Environment

*   **Tools/Libraries:**
    *   **Jest:** A versatile testing framework that can be used for both frontend and backend testing.
    *   **Supertest:** A library for testing HTTP servers, which is ideal for testing API endpoints.
*   **Setup:**
    1.  Install Jest and Supertest: `npm install --save-dev jest supertest`
    2. Configure jest by creating a `jest.config.js` file.
    3. Create a `__tests__` directory in the backend to store test files.

## 4. Test Coverage

### Concept

*   Test coverage is a metric that measures the percentage of code that is executed by tests.
*   It helps identify areas of the codebase that have not been adequately tested.

### Best Practices

*   **Aim for High Coverage:** Strive for high test coverage, ideally 80% or more, to ensure that most of the code is tested.
*   **Focus on Critical Areas:** Prioritize testing critical functionality, complex algorithms, and error-prone areas.
*   **Use Coverage Tools:** Use tools like Jest's built-in coverage reporting to identify untested code and improve test coverage.
*   **Write Meaningful Tests:** Focus on writing meaningful tests that cover various scenarios and edge cases, rather than just aiming for a high percentage.

## 5. Specific Test Cases

### General Structure

Each test case will follow this structure:

*   **Component/Module:** The part of the application being tested.
*   **Test Name:** A descriptive name for the test.
*   **Test Type:** Unit or integration.
*   **Test Description:** What the test is designed to verify.
*   **Expected Behavior:** The outcome if the code works correctly.
*   **Number of Tests:** The recommended number of tests for each scenario.
*   **Example Code:** An example of a test case.

## 6. Frontend Test Cases

### CodeGenerator Component

*   **Component/Module:** `CodeGenerator`
*   **Test Name:** `generates a 6-character alphanumeric code`
*   **Test Type:** Unit
*   **Test Description:** Verify that the component generates a random code that is exactly 6 characters
